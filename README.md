## Problem Description
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model for estimating car selling prices based on various features. Given a dataset containing information about different cars, including attributes such as the year of manufacture, selling price, present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission, and owner status, we aim to build a robust regression model that can accurately predict the selling price of a car.

Understanding the factors that influence car prices is crucial for both sellers and buyers in the automotive market. By analyzing the data and leveraging machine learning techniques, this project provides insights into price determination, potentially aiding in making informed buying and selling decisions.

### Key Objectives:
1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Handle missing values and transform categorical variables into numerical format.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features that may enhance model performance.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize data distributions and correlations among features.
4. **Model Development**: Use machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Extra Trees) to predict car prices.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using appropriate metrics and visualizations.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project, `car_data.csv`, contains the following columns:
- `Car_Name`: Name of the car
- `Year`: Year of manufacture
- `Selling_Price`: The price at which the car is sold
- `Present_Price`: The current market price of the car
- `Kms_Driven`: Total kilometers driven
- `Fuel_Type`: Type of fuel (Petrol, Diesel, CNG)
- `Seller_Type`: Type of seller (Dealer, Individual)
- `Transmission`: Type of transmission (Manual, Automatic)
- `Owner`: Number of previous owners
